A [Flarum](http://flarum.org) extension. Adds a virtual currency system to the Flarum community, allowing users to earn and spend points.

This extension is modified from [flarum-ext-money by AntoineFr](https://github.com/AntoineFr/flarum-ext-money). It's an excellent extension, and I want to express my gratitude to the original author. I have added some additional features that I needed and have published it here in the hope that you will enjoy it as well.

## Features

1. **All original features**: The extension retains all the functionalities of the original version.

2. **Points Record**: Added a feature to record all points transactions.

3. **Initial Points on Registration**: New users receive a set amount of points upon registration.

4. **Negative Points Deduction**: If points are set to negative, they will be deducted from the user's own account. If the account has insufficient points, the operation cannot be performed.

5. **Points Redistribution**: When points are negative, and the user replies to a discussion, the deducted points will be awarded to the discussion starter.

6. **Like Reward System**: When points are negative, points deducted from liking a post will be awarded to the person who received the like.

## Idea

   The design philosophy behind this system is a metaphor for time.

   Everything you do here consumes your time. If a task is completed without receiving any meaningful response, itâ€™s as if the task was done in vain. If a person continues to engage in meaningless activities, they are essentially wasting their time.

   For a similar concept, I recommend watching the movie _In Time_.
